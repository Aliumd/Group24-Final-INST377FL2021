    <h2>Our Objective</h2>
    <p>Our project is centered around the lack of accessible and effective 
        information design for young children wishing to learn about 
        United States presidents. 
    </p>

    <p>Although this may seem rather benign, a quick Google search to find 
        relevant, easily accessible information about presidents, 
        presented in a kid-friendly way can be difficult. Our final website is 
        intended to contain a cohesive, simple, broad, attractive, and 
        interesting overview of all of the United States presidents in a fashion
        geared towards children K-8 and their respecive educators.
    </p>

    <h2>Technical Specs</h2>
    <p>For our backend development, we utilized Node.js to develop JavaScript
        outside of a web browser. We used Express as a server frameowrk to 
        develop API's. We implemented Sequelize to manage our databse, which
        was created and maintined using MySQL.
    </p>

    <p>For our frontend development, we used the React framework with Create-
        React-App. Using the ReactJS web application, we were able to use 
        multiple separate components that each had their own logic and control.
        Using these distinct components across the app allowed made applications
        easier to develop and maintain. Virtual DOM was picked to help speed up
        application modification.
